This project will empirically test the CAPM theory using the model and method suggested by Lin(2013). We are curious to find out that, with GARCH-type volatilities and non-Normal errors, is the CAPM theory still alive in German Credit Default Swap (CDS) market? To test this hypothesis, we will analyze CDS prices for three major German Banks, Commerzbank (CB), Deutsche Bank (DB), and Dresdner Bank (DRB). We proposed to use Maximum Likelihood Estimation method (MLE) to estimate models via MatLab. In order to test the model, we will use Likelihood Ratio test (LR) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (KS) for model diagnostics. Furthermore, we are planning to compare our model with previous versions (normal error terms) by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).\r\n\r\nPrevious empirical results show modesl with GARCH-type volatilities and non-Normal errors can capture the skewness, fat tails and asymmetric kurtosis and fit the data better. We are eager to find out：\r\n> 1. Whether the CAPM theory is alive in German CDS market or not. \r\n> 2. What factor affect German CDS the most, or is there an index that shows strong correlation with German CDS. \r\n> 3. Compared with CAPM model with normal errors and GARCH-type volatilities, wheter the CAPM-SSAEPD-GARCH model fit data better or not.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### POSTER\r\nOur project poster could be found via the link: [Poster] (https://github.com/emmachow/GIT/files/54549/Project.Poster.pdf)\r\n\r\nHere is a glimpse:\r\n***\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16182412/11639099/ad2fae34-9cf8-11e5-8525-c159506d635a.jpg)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### PROJECT REPORT\r\nOur project report could be found at: [Project Report] (https://github.com/emmachow/GIT/files/54551/Machine.Learning.Project.pdf)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### CONCLUSION\r\nSharpe(1964), Lintner(1965) and Mossin(1966) propose the Capital Asset Pricing Model (denoted as the CAPM theory). In this paper, we empirically test this CAPM theory with the model and method of Lin(2013). In Lin(2013)'s model, both GARCH-type volatilities and SSAEPD errors are considered. Method of Maximum Likelihood Estimation is used to estimate parameters. Likelihood Ratio Test(LR) is used to test the hypotheses of parameter restrictions. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test(KS) is used to check residuals. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is used to compare models. \r\n\r\nEmpirical results show the model with GARCH-type volatilites and non-Normal errors can capture the skewness, fat tails and asymmetric kurtosis in the data. Our conclusion is:\r\n> 1. The CAPM theory is not alive in German CDSs since some CDSs earn the Alpha return. \r\n> 2. Most CDSs are significantly correlated with iTraxx Europe index. \r\n> 3. The CAPM-SSAEPD-GARCH model can fit data much better than CAPM-Normal-GARCH.\r\n\r\nFuture extensions will include but not limited to follows. First, we can exam our results with different data. Second, we can compare our new model with others such as VAR-Gaussian-Copula-SSAEPD model. Last, the new model can be applied to risk management such as Value-at-Risk(VaR).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### APPENDIX\r\nCodes could be found here: \r\n> 1.
