This project will empirically test the CAPM theory using the model and method suggested by Lin(2013). We are curious to find out that, with GARCH-type volatilities and non-Normal errors, is the CAPM theory still alive in German Credit Default Swap (CDS) market? To test this hypothesis, we will analyze CDS prices for three major German Banks, Commerzbank (CB), Deutsche Bank (DB), and Dresdner Bank (DRB). We proposed to use Maximum Likelihood Estimation method (MLE) to estimate models via MatLab. In order to test the model, we will use Likelihood Ratio test (LR) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (KS) for model diagnostics. Furthermore, we are planning to compare our model with previous versions (normal error terms) by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).\r\n\r\nPrevious empirical results show modesl with GARCH-type volatilities and non-Normal errors can capture the skewness, fat tails and asymmetric kurtosis and fit the data better. We are eager to find out 1) Whether the CAPM theory is alive in German CDS market or not. 2) What factor affect German CDS the most, or is there an index that shows strong correlation with German CDS. 3) Compared with CAPM model with normal errors and GARCH-type volatilities, wheter the CAPM-SSAEPD-GARCH model fit data better or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n### POSTER\r\nOur project poster could be found via the link [Poster] (https://github.com/emmachow/GIT/files/54549/Project.Poster.pdf)\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16182412/11639099/ad2fae34-9cf8-11e5-8525-c159506d635a.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### PROJECT REPORT\r\nOur project report could be found at [Report] (https://github.com/emmachow/GIT/files/54551/Machine.Learning.Project.pdf)\r\n\r\n\r\n### APPENDIX\r\nCodes could be found here [Project MATLAB Codes](https://github.com/emmachow/GIT/blob/master/aaa)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nChi Zhou, Qiwei Han\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
